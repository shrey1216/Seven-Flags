# Seven-Flags
The Seven Flags Theme Park Simulation is a Java program that provides a virtual experience of managing a theme park. It utilizes a double linked list data structure to efficiently manage the ride queues and simulate the park's operations. The program allows the creation of different rides with customizable durations, capacities, and holding queue sizes. Customers, categorized as regular, silver, or gold, can be added to the simulation. The interactive menu provides options to perform actions such as delivering packages, moving customers between rides, and printing ride queues. With ride statistics tracking and dynamic queue management, the Seven Flags Theme Park Simulation offers a realistic simulation of theme park operations.
